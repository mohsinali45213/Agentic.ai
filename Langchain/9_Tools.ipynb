      "2 weeks ago - LangChain is a software framework that helps facilitate the integration of large language models (LLMs) into applications . 1 week ago - LangChain is an open source framework for building applications based on large language models (LLMs). LLMs are large deep-learning models pre-trained on large amounts of data that can generate responses to user queries—for example, answering questions or creating images from text-based prompts. November 17, 2025 - LangChain is an open source orchestration framework for the development of applications using large language models (LLMs), like chatbots and virtual agents .

LangChain is a framework that allows developers to create agents capable of reasoning about issues and breaking them down into smaller sub-tasks .... July 7, 2025 - The advent of powerful AI large language models requires orchestration beyond simple API calls when developing real-world applications.
